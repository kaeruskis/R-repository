## 1. Vectors
```{r}
x=c(1,2,3)
x
```
We can mix data types in vector. When we do it, coercion happens and differents types of data become the same one.
```{r}
y=c(1,"a") #character
y=c(TRUE, 2) #numeric
y=c("a",TRUE) #character
```
How to coerce one class to another using functions:
```{r}
x=0:6
class(x)
as.numeric(x)
as.logical(x)
as.character(x)
```
Coercion will no always work, we can't convert characters to numeric or logical...
##List
```{r}
x=list(1,2,3)
```
